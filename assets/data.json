Like the last talk; You know I watched her on YouTube but it made me cry. And we witnesses these extreme experiences that trapped into women suppression and all these other things. But really that happens every day and we're all used to it in the workplace in relationships. Women are constantly suppressed but it takes an extreme circumstance for us to realise it because we're used to it. That always confuses me a lot.
