So I have always seen the right to vote as a huge responsability But now that I think about how how we don't really have an impact in Washington it feels like a slap in the face to all of us to every American and to every voter to the very principles our country was founded on liberty and our own pursuit of happiness. So I think that we can all agree that no matter what side of the aisle you're on, no matter if you hate politics and want nothing to do with it, this isn't right. A government that doesn't care about its people or that isn't governed by its people is just Un-American. And America can do better than this. And America must do better than this.
